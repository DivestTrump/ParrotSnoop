# ParrotSnoop
Android app for IP packet capture.

Currently supports IP TCP/UDP packet capture for IPv4 & IPv6 on Android devices. Allows you to export as CSV file.
Limitations: Cannot use with an Android VPN service.

There are three tabs.

The first tab shows you installed apps/packages with a checkmark for whether it's enabled.

Selecting an app/package will show you requested and granted permissions for the app/package.

The second tab allows you to capture, inspect and export.
